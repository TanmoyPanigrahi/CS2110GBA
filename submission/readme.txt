It’s like rock paper scissors. Snake beats water,
water beats gun, & gun beats snake. You are a red spirit
orb that has to choose one of the above to possess
to beat the Blue orb (computer). You move with the
arrow keys/ up-down-left-right and collide with object
to possess it. Press start/enter from home screen to start,
press select/backspace to return to the home screen and
reset any time you want.

You always win because this isn’t real life.
